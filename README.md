I propose to work on the heart attack prediction dataset from simplilearn This dataset and the relative problem is of health and the likelihood of patients to suffer heart attack. The context of the data is that given certain varibles, is one able to build a model that would correctly predict if a patient will suffer a heart attack.

1.What is the problem you want to solve?

*Being able to predict the likelihood of heart attacks for patients.

2.Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn?t have otherwise?

*Clients would include patients, hospitals, doctors, family members, care givers, health care providers etc.

3.What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

*Dataset from simplilearn

4.In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

*My approach will be to start with a model (most likely logistic regression) to get a baseline of performance and accuracy and then try to optimize model performance and implement other models for greater results.
